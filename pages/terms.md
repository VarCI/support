VarCI's service is free and designed to give you as much control over what is 
going on in your public project's issue tracker. However, be responsible in what 
you do. In particular, make sure that none of the prohibited items (like spam, 
viruses, or serious threats of violence) are the result of the rules we enforce 
on your behalf.

If you find a project that you believe violates these Terms of Service, please
[let us know](https://github.com/varci/support/issues/new).
